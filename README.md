Journaling app for mental health converted from a <a href="https://github.com/austinhutchen/Journal.NET.git">web variant</a>, which used ASP.NET and c#. Converted to an ios and android-compatible app using react native and state, ASYNCstorage, as well as some other DOM manipulations.
Used with typescript's localstorage() to preserve and cache state
